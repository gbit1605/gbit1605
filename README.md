### Hello! 👋
I'm Gunveen Batra, a dedicated enthusiast in the realms of data science and machine learning. Allow me to share a glimpse of my background:

🔭 Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in conducting a qualitative analysis of statements made by university presidents concerning the recent Israel-Hamas conflict.

🌱 I'm perpetually on a learning journey, with my current focus revolving around delving deeper into the Django web development framework.

🤔 My professional quest is to secure a full-time role in the capacities of a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, or Deep Learning Engineer.

💬 Feel free to engage me in discussions covering topics within the realm of data science, machine learning, or any technology-related subject.
